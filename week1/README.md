**DEFINITIONS**

***Convolution:***
To define convolution in a mathematical perspective, convolution is the measure of how much two functions/datapoints/images pixel values overlap on each other as they moves. 

***Filters/Kernels:***
These are 2D /3D dimesional matrices based on the application for which they are used, these kernel/filters objective is to extract the necessary features from the input given to them on which they perform convolution and extract features.

***Epoch:***
A visit to every data point present in the dataset by the model is generally termed as an epoch.

***1x1 Convolution:***
1 x 1 convolution is mainly used for reducing computation cost in a a network, to manipulate the depth of the input volume and can also used to add non linearity in the network.

***3x3 Convolution:***
This type of convolution helps in capturing small and complex features in an image and therby increasing the efficiency of feature extraction process.

***Feature Maps:***
Feature maps are also called as activation maps, which are used for extracting a particular feature from the input.

***Activation Function:***
A funcction which is a part of the neuron that decides what need to be transmitted as the output of that neuron after taking the weighted sum as input.

***Receptive Field:***
A field present in the input image/data for which a feature detector is looking for(Region of Interest).
